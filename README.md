# Khayyam-Triangle

The French mathematician, Blaise Pascal, who built a mechanical computer in  the 17th century, studied a pattern of numbers now commonly known in parts of  the world as Pascal's Triangle (it was also previously studied by many Indian,  Chinese, and Persian mathematicians, and is known by different names in other  parts of the world). Each number is the sum of the number above it to the left and the number above it to the right (any missing numbers are counted as 0).

Define a procedure, triangle(n), that takes a number n as its input, and returns a list of the first n rows in the triangle. Each element of the returned list should be a list of the numbers at the corresponding row in the triangle.
